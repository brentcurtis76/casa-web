## 📊 Ideal Ratios

**Participants:**
- 1 host : 3-5 guests = Perfect
- 1 host : 2 guests = Too few (but workable)
- 1 host : 6+ guests = Too many (getting crowded)

**First Month Target:**
- 15-30 total participants
- 3-6 hosts
- 9-24 guests

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "No Matches Created"
**Fix:** Need at least 1 host and 1 guest signed up

### "Email Not Delivered"
**Fix:** Check spam folder, verify email in user profile

### "Too Many Guests, Not Enough Hosts"
**Fix:** Recruit more hosts before deadline, or extend deadline

### "Participant Signed Up Twice"
**Fix:** System prevents this automatically, delete duplicate manually if needed
